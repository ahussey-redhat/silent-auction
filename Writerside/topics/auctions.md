# Auctions

> There are several ways to interact with auctions, as well as several actions that can be performed.

These actions include:
- Creating an auction
- Updating an auction
- Deleting an auction

To perform these actions, you will need to either have access to the official Silent Auction frontend, Silent Auction CLI, or utilise the Silent Auction backend APIs.
